 * Handle to an Azure Kinect capture.
 *
 * \remarks
 * A capture represents a set of images that were captured by a device at approximately the same time. A capture may
 * have a color, IR, and depth image. A capture may have up to one image of each type. A capture may have no image for a
 * given type as well.
 *
 * \remarks
 * Captures also store a temperature value which represents the temperature of the device at the time of the capture.
 *
 * \remarks
 * While all the images associated with the capture were collected at approximately the same time, each image has an
 * individual timestamp which may differ from each other. If the device was configured to capture depth and color images
 * separated by a delay, k4a_device_get_capture() will return a capture containing both image types separated by the
 * configured delay.
 *
 * \remarks
 * The capture will add a reference on any \ref k4a_image_t that is added to it with one of the setters like
 * k4a_capture_set_color_image(). If an existing image is being replaced, the previous image will have the reference
 * released.
 *
 * \remarks
 * Once all references to the \ref k4a_capture_t are released, the capture will release the references it holds on any
 * \ref k4a_image_t that are associated with it.
 *
 * \remarks
 * When a capture returns an image to the caller with an accessor like k4a_capture_get_color_image(), a new reference is
 * added to the \ref k4a_image_t and the caller is responsible for releasing that reference with k4a_image_release().
 *
 * \remarks
 * Empty captures are created with k4a_capture_create().
 *
 * \remarks
 * Captures can be obtained from a device using k4a_device_get_capture().
 *
 * \remarks
 * The caller must call k4a_capture_release() to release its reference to any \ref k4a_capture_t that it receives from
 * an Azure Kinect API.
 *
 * \remarks

 * Handle to an Azure Kinect image.
 *
 * \remarks
 * A \ref k4a_image_t manages an image buffer and associated metadata.
 *
 * \remarks
 * The memory associated with the image buffer in an \ref k4a_image_t may have been allocated by the Azure Kinect APIs
 * or by the application. If the \ref k4a_image_t was created by an Azure Kinect API, its memory will be freed when all
 * references to the \ref k4a_image_t are released. All images retrieved directly from a device will have been created
 * by the API. An application can create a \ref k4a_image_t using memory that it has allocated using
 * k4a_image_create_from_buffer(). In that case the memory is not freed when the references are released but instead the
 * application is provided with a callback. Applications need to create a k4a_image_t to provide as an output to the
 * k4a_transformation_t transformation functions.
 *
 * \remarks
 * An image has a number of metadata properties that can be set or retrieved using the accessor functions. Not all
 * properties are applicable to images of all types. See the documentation for the individual accessors for more
 * information on their applicability and meaning.
 *
 * \remarks
 * Images may be of one of the standard \ref k4a_image_format_t formats, or may be of format ::K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_CUSTOM.
 * The format defines how the underlying image buffer should be interpreted.
 *
 * \remarks
 * Images from a device are retrieved through a \ref k4a_capture_t object returned by k4a_device_get_capture().
 *
 * \remarks
 * Images stored in a k4a_capture_t are referenced by the k4a_capture_t until they are replaced or the k4a_capture_t is
 * destroyed.
