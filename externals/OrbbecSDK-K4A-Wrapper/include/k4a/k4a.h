 * The callback function to receive messages from. Set to NULL to unregister the callback function.

 * \param min_level
 * The least critical error the user wants to be notified about.
 *
 * \return ::K4A_RESULT_SUCCEEDED if the callback function was set or cleared successfully. ::K4A_RESULT_FAILED if an

 *
 * \remarks
 * Call this function to set or clear the callback function that is used to deliver debug messages to the caller. This
 * callback may be called concurrently, it is up to the implementation of the callback function to ensure the
 * parallelization is handled.
 *
 * \remarks
 * Clearing the callback function will block until all pending calls to the callback function have completed.

 * \remarks
 * To update \p min_level, \p k4a_set_debug_message_handler can be called with the same value \p message_cb and by
 * specifying a new \p min_level.
 *
 * \remarks
 * Logging provided via this API is independent of the logging controlled by the environmental variable controls \p
 * K4A_ENABLE_LOG_TO_STDOUT, \p K4A_ENABLE_LOG_TO_A_FILE, and \p K4A_LOG_LEVEL. However there is a slight change in
 * default behavior when using this function. By default, when \p k4a_set_debug_message_handler() has not been used to
 * register a message callback, the default for environmental variable controls is to send debug messages as if
 * K4A_ENABLE_LOG_TO_STDOUT=1 were set. If \p k4a_set_debug_message_handler registers a callback function before
 * k4a_device_open() is called, then the default for environmental controls is as if K4A_ENABLE_LOG_TO_STDOUT=0 was
 * specified. Physically specifying the environmental control will override the default.
